# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String
      
Difficulty:Easy

**A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.** 

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation:
Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aaabaaaa"
Output: "aabaa"
Explanation:
Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".
Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".
No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: "aab"
Explanation: No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s consists only of lowercase English letters.



# 1958. Check if Move is Legal

Difficulty:Medium

You are given a 0-indexed 8 x 8 grid board, where board[r][c] represents the cell (r, c) on a game board. On the board, free cells are represented by '.', white cells are represented by 'W', and black cells are represented by 'B'.

Each move in this game consists of choosing a free cell and changing it to the color you are playing as (either white or black). However, a move is only legal if, after changing it, the cell becomes the endpoint of a good line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).

A good line is a line of three or more cells (including the endpoints) where the endpoints of the line are one color, and the remaining cells in the middle are the opposite color (no cells in the line are free).

Given two integers rMove and cMove and a character color representing the color you are playing as (white or black), return true if changing cell (rMove, cMove) to color color is a legal move, or false if it is not legal.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: board = [[".",".",".","B",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","W",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","W",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","W",".",".",".","."],["W","B","B",".","W","W","W","B"],[".",".",".","B",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","B",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","W",".",".",".","."]], rMove = 4, cMove = 3, color = "B"
Output: true
Explanation: '.', 'W', and 'B' are represented by the colors blue, white, and black respectively, and cell (rMove, cMove) is marked with an 'X'.
The two good lines with the chosen cell as an endpoint are annotated above with the red rectangles.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: board = [[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".","B",".",".","W",".",".","."],[".",".","W",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".","W","B",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","."],[".",".",".",".","B","W",".","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".","W","."],[".",".",".",".",".",".",".","B"]], rMove = 4, cMove = 4, color = "W"
Output: false
Explanation: While there are good lines with the chosen cell as a middle cell, there are no good lines with the chosen cell as an endpoint.
``` 

**Constraints:**

* board.length == board[r].length == 8
* 0 <= rMove, cMove < 8
* board[rMove][cMove] == '.'
* color is either 'B' or 'W'.


# 1959. Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations

Difficulty:Medium

You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, where nums[i] is the number of elements that will be in the array at time i. In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you can resize the array (to any size).

The size of the array at time t, sizet, must be at least nums[t] because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The space wasted at time t is defined as sizet - nums[t], and the total space wasted is the sum of the space wasted across every time t where 0 <= t < nums.length.

Return the minimum total space wasted if you can resize the array at most k times.

Note: The array can have any size at the start and does not count towards the number of resizing operations.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,20], k = 0
Output: 10
Explanation: size = [20,20].
We can set the initial size to be 20.
The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) = 10.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [10,20,30], k = 1
Output: 10
Explanation: size = [20,20,30].
We can set the initial size to be 20 and resize to 30 at time 2. 
The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (30 - 30) = 10.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [10,20,15,30,20], k = 2
Output: 15
Explanation: size = [10,20,20,30,30].
We can set the initial size to 10, resize to 20 at time 1, and resize to 30 at time 3.
The total wasted space is (10 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (20 - 15) + (30 - 30) + (30 - 20) = 15.
```

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= nums.length <= 200
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 106
* 0 <= k <= nums.length - 1
  


# 1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings

Difficulty:Hard

You are given a 0-indexed string s and are tasked with finding two non-intersecting palindromic substrings of odd length such that the product of their lengths is maximized.

More formally, you want to choose four integers i, j, k, l such that 0 <= i <= j < k <= l < s.length and both the substrings s[i...j] and s[k...l] are palindromes and have odd lengths. s[i...j] denotes a substring from index i to index j inclusive.

Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two non-intersecting palindromic substrings.

A palindrome is a string that is the same forward and backward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ababbb"
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings "aba" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "zaaaxbbby"
Output: 9
Explanation: Substrings "aaa" and "bbb" are palindromes with odd length. product = 3 * 3 = 9.
```

**Constraints:**

* 2 <= s.length <= 105
* s consists of lowercase English letters.
